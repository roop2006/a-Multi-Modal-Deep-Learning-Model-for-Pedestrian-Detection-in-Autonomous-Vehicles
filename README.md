Introduction:
AI-Powered Pedestrian Detection System :Developed an intelligent system that combines camera images with LiDAR sensor data to accurately detect pedestrians in various conditions.
Real-World Safety Application Designed for autonomous vehicles, smart traffic systems, and surveillance to enhance pedestrian safety and prevent accidents in urban environments.
User-Friendly Web Platform Created a complete web-based solution with Flask backend and interactive frontend that allows users to upload images and get instant detection results.
Aim & Scope of the Work :
Primary Objective Develop a highly accurate real-time pedestrian detection system using multimodal sensor fusion to outperform traditional single-sensor approaches
Target Application Areas Focus on autonomous vehicle safety, smart city infrastructure, surveillance systems, and traffic management where pedestrian detection is critical
Future Expansion Potential Design extensible system architecture that supports additional sensors, different hardware platforms, and adaptation to various industry requirements.
Proposed Module:
RGB–LiDAR Fusion – Combine camera images with LiDAR depth data to capture both visual details and 3D structure for stronger pedestrian detection
Efficient Model Design – Use a lightweight deep learning model that can run faster while still keeping good accuracy.
Robust Detection – Train the system to handle different weather, lighting, and crowded situations so it works reliably in real environments.
Real-Time System – Build the pipeline to give quick results with low delay, making it suitable for use in autonomous vehicles
